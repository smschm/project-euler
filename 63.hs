K being n-digit means log K \in [n-1,n)
clearly no base over 10 can have this as the case

n-th power means that n\log K \in [n-1,n) or \log K \in [1-(1/n),1)

so we get: n = 1; [0,1): 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ^ 1
           n = 2; [0.5,1): 4,5,6,7,8,9 ^ 2
           n = 3; [0.66,1): 5,6,7,8,9 ^ 3
           n = 4; [0.75,1): 6,7,8,9 ^ 4
           ...
